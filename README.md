# COMP1004 Computing Practice Project

## Distribution Company Customer Support Chatbot

## Project Overview

This project is a browser-based customer support chatbot developed for the COMP1004 Computing Practice module. It was inspired by real operational challenges observed in distribution businesses, where staff often spend time responding to repetitive enquiries such as tracking deliveries, checking stock availability, receiving invoices, and logging customer issues.

The system provides a simple conversational interface that allows users to complete these tasks quickly through a single-page web application (SPA).

The chatbot is built entirely using frontend technologies (**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**) and runs locally in the browser without requiring a backend server or database.

* Check inventory / stock availability
* Upload invoice files through the chat interface
* Report customer issues or complaints
* Download inventory/order reports as PDF
